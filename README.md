Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
The main objective of Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is to use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal or a fraud.
The steps involved in the project are:
1. Read and understand the data
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Normalization of data
4. Visualization of correlations
5. Model Architecture-(Logistic Regression,KNeighborsClassifier)
6. Model Evaluation and Prediction
Conclusion:Using Logestic Regression and KNeighbors we get 97% and 97% accuracy respectively.
